# Beavering on...

    Roses are red, violets are blue,
    Beaver teeth are orange, and they gnaw through wood too.
    They build their dams, in rivers they weave,
    Creating a home, where the water is sieved.
    
    By the water's edge, under the moon's gentle gleam,
    Their busy paws work, crafting nature's own scheme.
    So let us rejoice, in this marvelous creature,
    As we celebrate the beaver and all unique features.
