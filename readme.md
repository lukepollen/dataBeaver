A Python package focused on metaprogramming and support for commonly used functionality across projects.

The design philosophy for metabeaver is to enhancement some Python functionality, such as conditional printing, as well as a reference point for data structures, algorithms, and a framework for debugging code. 

Databeaver provides core data structures and algorithms implemented in Python, answers to common programming interview problems optimised for space and time complexity, integrations with Google BigQuery / Compute / Storage which can be abstracted to the other cloud providers, a few friendly string formatting and printing functionalities, and an explanation of bit functionality with reference to mushrooms + beaver-inspired poetry.

Metabeaver aims to be a reference point for computer science knowledge with detailed code for responses to typical interview questions - a mixture of theoretical and practical knowledge. Metabeaver hopes to offer a few Pythonic quality of life upgrades and smooth integration with cloud services, wrapped in a codebase which may at times actually be funny to read through. 

Metabeaver began life as a code repository to dam together code commonly used across projects. It is hoped it is, at least, a useful reference with some time saving debugging and general Python quality of life functionality.
